    "The Yellow Woodpecker (fictional company) is a Brazilian travel agency recognized for the quality of its services. In an effort to improve its services and increase customer retention, the company decided to seek together with its Data Science Team, a possible strategy to improve the satisfaction of its customers. During the analysis, it was noticed that the satisfaction rate to travel accommodation of some customers was significantly getting variation, and not always achieve the expected satisfaction. In view of this, the Data Science Team proposed a project to segment all hotels in the destination trip, and then based oh the greater satisfaction of accommodation from a previous trip, create a system to suggest Hotels based on the similarity of nearby venues, to increase the likelihood of high satisfaction with the accommodation service provided."
